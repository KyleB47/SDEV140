Name: Fitness Tracker 

Purpose: Track simple workouts mainly outside of the gym. To keep it simple I will just do Cardio and body-weight exercises like push ups and sit ups which can be done virtually anywhere.

Reason: To keep track of workouts and make each workout more efficient.  Not working the same muscles and keeping track of progress.  Seeing your progress even a little bit will help mentally.  If you start a streak and you can visually see it, it would be harder to break that streak for any reason.  

Goals: Simple and intuitive GUI that allows users to pick workout/exercises and simply input the number of reps or miles and keeps track of that information for the user.  User can know when to start increasing the intensity of the workouts.
Target: All adults who exercise.  Must have smart phone or device that can run app.

Outline 
•	What exercises the app can track – Tried to pick simple exercises that do not need equipment and can be done anywhere.  Please let me know if I missed anything or need to add anything.  I tried to make sure I covered the whole body as best as possible.

-Any variation of Sit ups 
-Pull ups/Chin ups
-Any variation of Squats
-Calf Raises
-Jumping Jacks


•	What inputs are allowed 

o	Decided to not allow user to input what exercise even though that would limit the program but it will make it easier for me if I’m being honest.  

o	Just click on the picture or description and then it should prompt the user the enter the specific numbers:

-Body Workouts will ask for:
•	Which pre chosen exercise
•	How many overall sets 
•	How many reps in each set

-Cardio
•	Which pre chosen cardio
•	Total Time 

•	App tracks workout through csv file

o	All user input 
o	Need to figure out how to save results to file or simply print them out after user’s workout 
-Most likely save to file so they can keep track and modify if they need to

•	Generic names to label each exercise so it’s universal 
o	This program you should be able to take anywhere and track SIMPLE workouts and exercises 
•	How many exercises? See above but:
o	3 Cardio 
o	5 Body weight exercises 

•	Should it all be point and click or should user input specifics
o	User will point and click on the excersise and then would be prompted to enter the specifics as shown above.
